# thisis

this git repository for **thisis** was started June 2016, but the project is at least eight years older than that.

I created thisis as a scripting language for geometric drawing.

Background context see for example <http://phd.samuelfreeman.me.uk/a/doku.php?id=2010:thisis>

Functional implementations exist in MaxMsp and sdfsysbeta.

A new implementation is being developed in Python - see pythisis
