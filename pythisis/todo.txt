let angles increase in a clockwise direction 
by adding an option to change it...
maybe the commmand could be:
/!>>> set drawing theta+ cw
for angles to increase clockwise, and
/!>>> set drawing theta+ ccw
for angles to increase counter-clockwise...
... complementary syntax would also be permitted, such as:
/!>>> set drawing theta- cw
(which is the current behaviour, and mathematical norm)
also allow acw == ccw



add */ to list of kw for single line comment 
so that it will not return as /= */ when the preceding  /* is removed
